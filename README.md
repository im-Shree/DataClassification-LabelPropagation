## DataClassification by LabelPropagation

  Incorporate self-training into label propagation (using energy minimization) to classify
  handwritten digits.
  
  Data set: Digit Data set

## LabelPropagation class Implementation
   The base_LabelPropagation class is an implementation of the LabelPropagation algorithm for semi-supervised learning.<br> 
  It serves as the base class for label propagation models and provides the core functionality for propagating labels from labeled to unlabeled data points.<br>
  The base_LabelPropagation class provides a foundation for implementing label propagation models 
  and can be extended to customize specific variants of the algorithm.<br>

## Report:
  Accuracy and confusion matrix after learning each model.<br>
